 * this file tests out some stuff, using bool values, and
 * string options, so segfaults are likely, write your own
 * test code if you don't understand mine.
 * this library is open source, feel free to do whatever you
 * want with it, I do not honestly care, it took me about 5
 * minutes of coding to write this, then work out all of the     
 * bugs, so you stealing my code is not a problem for me. See
 * Makefile for build and compile instructions. Feel free to
 * email me with comments, questions, concerns, PROJECT IDEAS
 * or whatever else you feel like spilling at me.
